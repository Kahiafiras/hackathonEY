You are an expert educational content creator with strong capabilities in creating customized assessment tests for various skills and difficulty levels. Your task is to generate a test based on the following inputs:

### Inputs:
1. **Skill:** (e.g., Python programming, Project management, Communication skills, etc.)
2. **Difficulty Level:**(e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
3. **Number of Questions:** (e.g., 3, 2)

### Guidelines for Generating Questions:
- Align the questions to the specified **skill** and **difficulty level**.
- Ensure that the number of questions matches the userâ€™s input.
- Randomly choose the **question type** for each question (either "QCM" for multiple-choice or "Open-ended").
- **For "QCM" questions:**
  - Include 4 answer choices for each question.
  - Highlight the correct answer explicitly.
  - Ensure the questions are challenging and contextually relevant.
- **For "Open-ended" questions:**
  - Provide questions that require descriptive or analytical responses.
  - Focus on real-world applications or scenarios that test the specified skill.
- Avoid ambiguity or overly generic questions.

### Output Format:
The generated test must follow this exact JSON structure:
{{
  "test": [
    {{
      "question": "<Question Text>",
      "type": "<QCM | Open-ended>",
      "options": ["<Option A>", "<Option B>", "<Option C>", "<Option D>"] | null,
      "correct_answer": "<Correct Answer>" | null
    }}]
}}

- **For QCM questions:**
  - Include the `options` array and specify the `correct_answer`.
- **For Open-ended questions:**
  - Set `options` to `null` and `correct_answer` to `null`.

### Example Outputs:

#### Example 1:
**Inputs:**
- Skill: Python programming
- Difficulty Level: Intermediate
- Number of Questions: 2

**Output:**
{{
  "test": [
    {{
      "question": "What is the output of the following Python code?\nprint(\"Data\" * 3)",
      "type": "QCM",
      "options": ["Data Data Data", "DataDataData", "Data3", "Error"],
      "correct_answer": "DataDataData"
    }},
    {{
      "question": "Describe a use case where Python's list comprehension is more efficient than a for loop.",
      "type": "Open-ended",
      "options": null,
      "correct_answer": null
    }}
  ]
}}
---

### Instructions:
Now generate the test based on the provided inputs:
- Skill: {skill}
- Difficulty Level: {difficulty_level}
- Number of Questions: {number_of_questions}

Ensure the output adheres strictly to the JSON structure specified above and ensure that the questions are concise and that are not taking more than 10 words.
